# SvelteKit Bootstrap Integration Demo

This project demonstrates how to integrate **[Svelte](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction)** and **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction)** within a SvelteKit application. The goal is to leverage Bootstrap's CSS and JavaScript components seamlessly alongside Svelte for building fast, responsive web applications.

### How It Works

This demo integrates Bootstrap for both styling and interactive components such as modals, dropdowns, and tooltips. Bootstrap's SCSS files are imported to allow custom theme colors, while JavaScript functionality is dynamically initialized using Svelteâ€™s `onMount` lifecycle hook. This ensures Bootstrap's dynamic features are fully operational within Svelte components.

### Usage

The project showcases:
- **Dynamic components**: Bootstrap JavaScript components (e.g., tooltips) are initialized on page load via Svelte's lifecycle hooks.
- **Custom theming**: Bootstrap SCSS is customized with new theme colors for primary and danger classes.
